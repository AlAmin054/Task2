## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a Python program to analyze process simulation data. The primary goal is to identify trends in efficiency and resource utilization while highlighting bottlenecks and optimizing resource allocation through basic calculations and visualizations

## Project task
1. Data Import and Cleaning
Import simulation data from a single CSV file.
Handle missing values by replacing them with the median value for the respective column.
2. Basic Analysis
Calculate average processing times for each task.
Compute resource utilization rates, e.g., percentage of machine usage.
Identify tasks with the highest resource consumption.
3. Trend Analysis
Compare average processing times across different task categories.
Group tasks by resource usage levels (low, medium, high) and analyze trends.
4. Visualization
The program includes visualizations to enhance data understanding:

Bar Chart: Compares processing times across tasks.
Line Chart: Displays resource utilization trends over time.
Pie Chart: Shows the distribution of resource usage across tasks.


## Tools and Libraries
1. **Pandas** for data import, cleaning, and manipulation.  
2. **NumPy** for numerical computations and handling missing values.  
3. **Matplotlib** for creating bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.  
4. **Seaborn** for enhanced and visually appealing charts.  
5. **OpenPyXL** for exporting results to Excel (optional).  
6. **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development and visualization.

## How to run the project
To run the project, follow these steps:  

1. **Set Up the Environment**:  
   - Install Python (preferably version 3.8 or higher).  
   - Install the required libraries using `pip`.  

2. **Prepare the Data**:  
   - Place the CSV file containing the process simulation data in the project directory.  

3. **Run the Program**:  
   - Open the project in your chosen development environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code).  
   - Execute the script or notebook step by step to process the data and generate results.  

4. **View Outputs**:  
   - Check the console for calculations and results.  
   - Visualizations (bar chart, line chart, pie chart) will be displayed during execution.  

5. **Analyze Results**:  
   - Use the charts and metrics to identify trends, bottlenecks, and resource optimization opportunities.  

## Conclusion
The project aims to streamline process efficiency and optimize resource utilization by analyzing simulation data. Through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, bottlenecks and trends can be identified. The generated insights help in making informed decisions for better resource allocation and overall process improvement.
